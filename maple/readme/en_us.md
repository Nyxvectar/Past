The heatmap here is obtained through analysis using a [third-party web tool](https://www.patrick-wied.at/projects/heatmap-keyboard/).
- _From top to bottom are QWERTY, colemak, and maple layouts, English first and then Chinese._
- _The English analysis sample is the LICENSE document of the AGPL - 3.0 agreement, and the Chinese analysis sample is the full - pinyin original input of its Chinese translation._

### Why the Maple Layout Exists

_In early 2024, I started getting in touch with the mechanical keyboard community. After researching for a while, I bought a Machenike K99. I thought that since I bought a custom mechanical keyboard, I should have a good time tinkering with it.
After that, I also studied some things, such as Hi - Fi, keycaps, and the important question of whether using thermal, wind, or nuclear power for the keyboard would make typing more enjoyable._
When trying keyboard layouts like Dvorak and colemak, one thing was really bad. I hoped that the positions of the keycaps would be adjusted along with the keyboard layout.
However, the layered design of OEM keycaps makes the keyboard uneven to use and look weird after swapping positions without permission.
Following the advice of a B - station friend, I went to look for XDA keycaps. There were not many products available, and customization was expensive. Also, I didn't think a set of keycaps that cost almost the same as the keyboard had any cost - effectiveness.
Even if I brought the XDA keycaps home after getting them ready, the typing feel was hard to describe. They were pretty much useless except for looking good. I wanted to pursue both aesthetics and practicality, so this was unacceptable.
During my research, I also saw many people saying that these keyboard layouts were designed for English after all, and there is actually a lack of a suitable keyboard layout for Chinese. So, I got an idea:
Create a keyboard layout that can **suit typing in both Chinese and English**, **not require spending money on keycaps**, and **show individuality**.
